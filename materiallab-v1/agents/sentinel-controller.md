# Sentinel Agent Controller

*Central orchestrator for MaterialLab's anti-slop enforcement system*

## Overview

The Sentinel Agent Controller coordinates a network of specialized evaluation agents to ensure all MaterialLab outputs maintain brand distinctiveness and human-centric quality standards. It serves as the primary interface for the multi-agent anti-slop enforcement system.

## Architecture

```typescript
interface SentinelController {
  evaluation_pipeline: {
    intake: "Receive content for evaluation across domains"
    routing: "Distribute to specialized evaluators based on content type"
    coordination: "Manage parallel evaluation processes"
    synthesis: "Aggregate results from all evaluators"
    reporting: "Generate actionable feedback and scores"
  }
  
  agent_network: {
    ux_evaluator: "User experience and interface design evaluation"
    visual_evaluator: "Photography, illustration, and graphic design evaluation"
    copy_evaluator: "Written content and voice consistency evaluation"
    code_evaluator: "Code quality and documentation evaluation"
  }
  
  brand_integration: {
    brand_api_access: "Real-time access to machine-readable brand guidelines"
    context_awareness: "Understanding of current project and audience context"
    historical_consistency: "Comparison with previous MaterialLab outputs"
  }
}
```

## Core Responsibilities

### Content Intake and Classification

```typescript
interface ContentClassificationSystem {
  content_types: {
    "ui_component": { evaluators: ["ux_evaluator"], priority: "high" }
    "hero_copy": { evaluators: ["copy_evaluator", "ux_evaluator"], priority: "high" }
    "illustration": { evaluators: ["visual_evaluator"], priority: "medium" }
    "code_component": { evaluators: ["code_evaluator", "ux_evaluator"], priority: "high" }
    "documentation": { evaluators: ["copy_evaluator", "code_evaluator"], priority: "medium" }
    "marketing_asset": { evaluators: ["visual_evaluator", "copy_evaluator"], priority: "high" }
  }
  
  routing_logic: {
    single_domain: "Route to primary evaluator only"
    cross_domain: "Route to multiple evaluators and synthesize results"
    complex_assets: "Sequential evaluation with dependency management"
  }
}
```

### Evaluation Orchestration

```typescript
interface EvaluationOrchestration {

      brand_alignment: 85
      anti_slop_compliance: 90
      human_centricity: 80
      transparency_score: 85
    }
    
    escalation_triggers: {
      below_threshold: "Flag for human review"
      conflicting_evaluations: "Request clarification from evaluators"
      edge_cases: "Escalate to subject matter experts"
    }
  }
