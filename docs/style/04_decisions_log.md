# Design Decisions Log

This document records significant design system decisions, their rationale, and any changes over time. It serves as historical context for future team members and helps maintain consistency in decision-making.

## Decision Template

For each major decision, include:
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Rationale**: The reasoning behind the choice
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Impact**: Areas of the system affected
- **Status**: Active, Modified, or Deprecated

## Decisions

### 2025-01-22: Dual Color Palette Strategy

**Decision**: Implement two distinct color palettes rather than a single brand palette.

**Context**: The brand guidelines identified two different market positioning approaches - "Humanistic Intelligence" (warm, approachable) and "Structured Dynamism" (bold, tech-forward). 

**Rationale**: 
- Provides flexibility for different client types and project contexts
- Allows testing of market response to different brand expressions
- Maintains brand consistency while enabling contextual adaptation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single palette with tonal variations
- Seasonal palette switching
- Client-customizable color schemes

**Impact**: 
- Design system supports both light/dark modes for each palette
- Components must be tested in both color environments
- Documentation complexity increased but provides clearer guidance

**Status**: Active

### 2025-01-22: Typography Hierarchy - Three Font System

**Decision**: Use Inter (headlines/UI), Source Serif 4 (body), JetBrains Mono (code) as the core typography system.

**Context**: Need for clear hierarchy that supports both technical content and human-centric communication.

**Rationale**:
- Inter: Screen-optimized sans-serif with excellent legibility at all sizes
- Source Serif 4: Adds credibility and "Sage" archetype reinforcement for long-form content
- JetBrains Mono: Developer-focused with distinct character shapes for code clarity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- All sans-serif approach (Inter + Inter variants)
- Custom font development
- Google Fonts-only solution for faster loading

**Impact**: 
- Requires three font families to be loaded
- Creates clear content hierarchy
- Supports both technical and editorial content types

**Status**: Active

### 2025-01-22: 4px Grid Spacing System

**Decision**: Implement spacing tokens based on 4px increments.

**Context**: Need for mathematical harmony and consistency across all spacing decisions.

**Rationale**:
- 4px provides enough granularity for fine details while maintaining simplicity
- Aligns with common design tool defaults and mobile pixel densities
- Creates predictable rhythm and visual harmony

**Alternatives Considered**:
- 8px base grid (less granular)
- 2px base grid (too granular, too many options)
- Non-mathematical spacing scale

**Impact**: 
- All margins, padding, and layout dimensions use the scale
- Reduces decision fatigue for designers and developers
- Ensures visual consistency across components

**Status**: Active

### 2025-01-22: Anti-Pattern Documentation Strategy

**Decision**: Create comprehensive anti-pattern documentation alongside positive guidelines.

**Context**: AI industry saturated with generic visual clich√©s and problematic UX patterns.

**Rationale**:
- Proactive prevention more efficient than reactive fixing
- Helps team avoid unconscious bias toward generic "AI aesthetics"
- Provides clear guidance on ethical AI implementation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Positive-only documentation
- Separate ethics guidelines document
- Industry best practices reference only

**Impact**: 
- Larger documentation scope but clearer boundaries
- Helps differentiate brand from generic AI companies
- Supports ethical AI development practices

**Status**: Active

### 2025-01-22: Atomic Design Component Organization

**Decision**: Organize component specifications using atomic design methodology (atoms, molecules, organisms).

**Context**: Need for scalable component documentation that grows with system complexity.

**Rationale**:
- Provides clear component hierarchy and relationships
- Industry-standard methodology with established patterns
- Scales from simple elements to complex layouts

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flat component list
- Functional categorization (forms, navigation, etc.)
- Custom taxonomy

**Impact**: 
- Component documentation structure established
- Clear guidelines for component complexity levels
- Easier onboarding for new team members

**Status**: Active

### 2025-01-22: AI Agent Integration

**Decision**: Create specific documentation for AI agents building and reviewing designs.

**Context**: Studio uses AI assistants for development and design review processes.

**Rationale**:
- Ensures AI tools follow brand guidelines consistently
- Reduces human oversight needed for routine tasks
- Enables scalable design system enforcement

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Human-only design process
- Generic AI prompting without system-specific guidance
- Automated validation tools only

**Impact**: 
- New documentation category required
- AI agents can provide consistent design system adherence
- Faster development cycles with maintained quality

**Status**: Active

## Modification Process

To record a new decision:

1. Add entry using the template above
2. Include all required fields
3. Link to related documentation or PRs
4. Update any affected documentation
5. Communicate change to relevant team members

To modify an existing decision:
