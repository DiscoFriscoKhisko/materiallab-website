# Copy Anti-Slop Playbook

*Comprehensive guide for creating distinctive, human-centric content that embodies MaterialLab's voice while avoiding generic AI communication patterns*

## Overview

Copy slop manifests as formulaic, vague text that lacks MaterialLab's distinctive voice and fails to communicate our human-centric approach to AI. This playbook provides specific techniques for creating content that is transparent, empowering, and authentically MaterialLab.

## Copy Slop Identification

### Generic AI Communication Patterns to Avoid

#### **Anthropomorphic Language**
❌ **Forbidden Patterns**:
- "Our AI thinks the best approach is..."
- "The model believes this solution will work"
- "AI understands your needs"
- "The system has learned that..."
- "AI knows what you're looking for"

✅ **MaterialLab Alternatives**:
- "Based on data analysis, the recommended approach is..."
- "Pattern recognition suggests this solution will work"
- "AI analysis indicates alignment with your needs"
- "The system has identified patterns showing..."
- "AI analysis found matches for your requirements"

#### **Overpromising and Vague Claims**
❌ **Forbidden Patterns**:
- "Revolutionary AI breakthrough"
- "Game-changing technology"
- "Seamless integration"
- "Effortless automation"
- "Magical AI capabilities"

✅ **MaterialLab Alternatives**:
- "Significant advancement in AI collaboration"

AI Analysis Complete (87% confidence)

Based on your team's velocity over the last 6 sprints and similar project patterns, extending your timeline by 1 week would significantly increase delivery quality. 

Here's how we reached this recommendation:
• Your team averages 23 story points per sprint
• This project estimates to 67 story points  
• Similar complexity projects typically need 15% time buffer

You can:
• Apply this recommendation to your timeline
• Adjust the parameters to see other options
• Skip AI suggestions and plan manually
• Learn more about how we calculate these estimates

Timeline Dates Need Adjustment
The start date you entered is after the end date. This often happens when dates get switched around during planning.

What you can do:
• Swap the dates automatically (Start: March 1, End: March 15)
• Edit the dates manually
• Contact support if you need help with project planning

---

AI Analysis Taking Longer Than Expected
Your project has more data than usual, extending our analysis time to about 3 more minutes.

Your options:
• Continue waiting (we'll notify you when complete)
• Skip AI analysis and plan manually  
• Reduce data scope to speed up processing

Your project data is secure and we'll complete the analysis whether you wait or skip.

---

File Upload Interrupted
The upload stopped at 67% - this usually happens with slower internet connections on files over 5MB.

How to proceed:
• Resume upload (we saved your progress)
• Try again with a smaller file
• Compress your file to reduce size
• Use our direct email option for large files
```
