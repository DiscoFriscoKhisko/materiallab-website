# UX Evaluator Agent

*Specialized agent for evaluating user experience and interface design against MaterialLab's human-centric standards*

## Overview

The UX Evaluator Agent specializes in assessing user interfaces, user experience patterns, and interaction design to ensure they embody MaterialLab's human-centric approach to AI integration. It focuses on identifying generic UX patterns and enforcing MaterialLab's distinctive design philosophy.

## Core Evaluation Criteria

# UX Evaluation Report: Project Dashboard Component

## Executive Summary
**Overall Score: 78/100** ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

**Strengths:**
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper MaterialLab design tokens
- Good accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Effective progressive disclosure implementation

**Critical Improvements Needed:**
- AI analysis section lacks proper transparency implementation
- Generic dashboard layout doesn't reflect user story-driven design
- Missing user control options for AI-generated insights

**MaterialLab Brand Alignment:** Needs Improvement

## Detailed Analysis

### Human-Centricity Assessment: 72/100
**Strengths:**
- Users have clear control over dashboard configuration
- Good accessibility with keyboard navigation support

**Areas for Improvement:**
- AI insights presented without explanation or confidence levels
- No user override options for AI-generated recommendations
- Limited transparency about how AI analysis is performed

**Required Changes:**
```tsx
// ❌ Current Implementation
<InsightCard>
  <h3>Project Risk Analysis</h3>
  <p>High risk detected for timeline completion</p>
  <Button>View Details</Button>
</InsightCard>

// ✅ MaterialLab Implementation
<InsightCard>
  <AILabel variant="analysis" confidence={87} />
  <h3>Timeline Risk Assessment</h3>
  <p>Based on team velocity and project scope, timeline extension recommended</p>
  <ExpandableExplanation>
    Analysis considered: team sprint velocity (23 pts/sprint), 
    current scope (67 pts), historical project patterns...

    <Button variant="secondary">Modify Parameters</Button>
    <Button variant="text">Override Analysis</Button>
  </UserControls>
</InsightCard>
```

### Anti-Slop Compliance: 75/100
**Violations Detected:**
1. Generic dashboard grid layout without user context consideration
2. Standard metric cards that don't reflect user story priorities  
3. Missing MaterialLab voice in instructional copy

**Brand Inconsistencies:**
- Using generic "Dashboard" terminology instead of user-focused language
- Metric presentation follows standard patterns vs user goal optimization
- Missing MaterialLab's human-centric messaging

**Recommendations:**
1. Redesign layout to prioritize user's most critical Monday morning review needs
2. Replace generic metric cards with user story-driven status indicators
3. Update copy to reflect MaterialLab's empowering, educational voice

## Actionable Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (This Sprint)
1. **Add AI Transparency** - Implement AILabel components for all AI-generated insights
2. **User Control Options** - Add override and modification controls for AI recommendations
3. **Confidence Indicators** - Show confidence levels for AI analysis with explanations

### Design Enhancements (Next Sprint)  
1. **User Story Optimization** - Redesign layout based on specific user contexts (project manager Monday morning review)
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Implement expandable details for complex analyses
3. **Accessibility Improvements** - Enhanced screen reader support for dynamic content

### Brand Alignment Improvements (Ongoing)
1. **Voice Consistency** - Update all copy to MaterialLab's sage-creator archetype
2. **Human-Centric Messaging** - Emphasize AI assistance rather than AI decision-making
3. **Educational Elements** - Add learning opportunities about AI analysis methods
```
