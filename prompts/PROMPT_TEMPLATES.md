  persona: string // Specific expert role with MaterialLab context
  brand_context: {
    core_values: ["human-centric", "transparent", "empowering", "meticulous"]
    voice_archetype: "The Sage + The Creator"
    anti_slop_awareness: "Avoid generic AI company patterns"
  }
  
  // Task specification
  context: {
    user_story?: string // Specific user context when applicable
    business_objective: string // What this accomplishes for MaterialLab
    target_audience: "technical" | "business" | "general"
  }
  
  task: {
    primary_objective: string // Clear, specific goal
    deliverable_format: string // Exact output structure required
    success_criteria: string[] // How to measure quality
  }
  
  // Quality controls
  constraints: {
    brand_compliance: string[] // Specific MaterialLab requirements
    anti_patterns: string[] // What to avoid
    technical_requirements?: string[] // Domain-specific needs
  }
  
  validation: {
    brand_voice_check: "Does this sound like MaterialLab speaking?"
    human_centricity_check: "Does this empower rather than replace humans?"
    transparency_check: "Is AI involvement and process clear?"
    uniqueness_check: "Is this distinctly MaterialLab, not generic?"
  }
}
```

## Few-Shot Learning Templates

### Content Style Transfer Template

```typescript
const FEW_SHOT_CONTENT_TEMPLATE = `
You are writing content for MaterialLab in our distinctive brand voice. Study these examples to understand our communication style, then apply it to the new content request.

## Example 1: Technical Explanation (Educational + Transparent)
**Context**: Explaining AI confidence scores to business users
**Output**: 
"AI confidence scores help you understand how certain our analysis is about a recommendation. A score of 85% means we found strong patterns in your data that support this suggestion, but you should still review it against your specific context. Scores below 70% usually mean we need more information or that human expertise is especially important for this decision."

## Example 2: Feature Introduction (Excited + User-Focused)  
**Context**: Announcing new AI-assisted project planning
**Output**:
"Better project planning insights now available. Your project timelines just got smarter with AI analysis that spots potential scheduling conflicts before they become problems. The AI examines your team's actual work patterns to suggest realistic timelines, showing confidence levels so you know when to trust the analysis. You maintain full control over all timeline decisions."

## Example 3: Error Message (Solution-Focused + Non-Blame)
**Context**: File upload failure
**Output**:
"Upload paused at 67% — this usually happens with larger files on slower connections. You can resume the upload (we saved your progress), try with a smaller file, or use our email option for files over 10MB."

## Example 4: UI Microcopy (Direct + Empowering)
**Context**: Button text for AI analysis feature
**Output**: 
"Analyze Timeline" (not "Run AI" or "Get Recommendations")

## Example 5: AI Interaction Copy (Transparent + Collaborative)
**Context**: Presenting AI recommendations
**Output**:
"Based on your team's velocity over 6 sprints and similar project patterns, extending timeline by 1 week would significantly improve delivery quality. Here's how we reached this: [specific factors]. You can apply this recommendation, adjust parameters to see other options, or skip AI suggestions and plan manually."

## Pattern Analysis
Notice how MaterialLab content:
- Leads with user benefit, not technology features
- Explains AI reasoning in human terms
- Always provides user control and alternatives  
- Uses confident but not arrogant tone
- Focuses on augmenting human capability
- Avoids anthropomorphizing AI
- Provides specific, actionable information

## Your Task
Create ${CONTENT_TYPE} for ${CONTEXT} that matches MaterialLab's voice demonstrated in the examples above.

**Requirements**:
- Match the tone and style patterns shown
- Focus on human empowerment and control
- Explain any AI involvement transparently
- Provide specific, actionable information
- Maintain MaterialLab's distinctive voice
